# Birdy Go Core

Built with `Vite` + `React` + `TypeScript SWC`. 

Besides that, I'm using:
- `tailwind`
- `react-aria-components`
- `react-icons`
- `react-hook-form`
- `@tanstack/react-table`

## Features

> **Reactivity** based on `react-aria`

> **Customization** with `tailwind`, customize adding classes or remove default styles completely

## Environment variables
